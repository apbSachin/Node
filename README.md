# Node is runtime environment for excuting javascript code. its not a programming language

# synchronus and blocking :once we send request we need to wait for response until it fetches from database;

                                # or

# Synchronous operations in JavaScript execute one after another in a sequential manner. When a synchronous operation is encountered, the program waits for it to complete before moving on to the next operation. This means that each operation blocks the execution of the code until it finishes.



# asynchronous and non-blocking: once we request it ll go and request database and again it take another request and tell database for data; here no need to wait for response until it fetches from database


                                            # or

# Asynchronous operations, on the other hand, do not block the program's execution. When an asynchronous operation is initiated, the program doesn't wait for it to complete but continues with the next operation. When the asynchronous operation finishes, it notifies the program through a callback function, a promise, or an event handler.
